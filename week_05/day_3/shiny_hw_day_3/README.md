# R Shiny App

---

Week 5, day 3 homework:
Make a shiny app dashboard.

# Data

I downloaded my workout data from the Apple Health app on my phone. I cleaned the data and filtered it down to three columns, Month, Activity and Date. Once I had this I wrote the data to a new `.csv` file and read the data in to shiny.

# App

My goal with the app was to show checkboxes to allow you to select which month or months you would like to look at and a drop down menu to let you choose the activity type.

I also tried to add a logo into the sidebar box.
